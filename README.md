# My Next.js Blog

This is a Next.js blog site that stores articles in markdown format and uses a MongoDB Atlas realtime database to store all data. It also utilizes an uploadthing.com account to store images and videos. The blog includes a markdown editor for creating and editing articles and integrates with the OpenAI API to allow privileged members to generate blog posts based on prompts. User authentication and management are handled by clerk.com authentication manager. The comments data from the site articles is stored in MongoDB to improve AI-assisted article generation and increase traffic. The blog also includes a translation layer for localization.
